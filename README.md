## Purple Pedal Documention 

This repo contains all of the code for the Purple Pedal documentation site. 

## Technical Details 

This site uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). From the MkDocs site
>MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.
>Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

## To build / run locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Open a terminal window and `cd` into the root folder of this repo
3. `pip install mkdocs` (to install mkdocs and what it needs)
4. `mkdocs serve` (runs a local web server on port 8000)

## Contribution Process 

We will need a better process when more people contribute to this project, but for now our contribution process should go something like this:
1. Pull most recent changes
2. Make your change
3. Push your change

We will be working in separate files for the most part, and since these files are markdown files, you can just modify the files in github directly and pull the repo and run locally.
