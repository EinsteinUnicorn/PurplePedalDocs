## The Purple Pedal
*An open source experimental effects platform!*

The **Purple Pedal** is an open source, reprogrammable, audio effects device based on the Daisy Seed. It features a very simple guitar pedal style interface to with various digital audio effects. 

It leverages the reprogrammable I/O on the daisy seed to enable more varieties of musical expression when couple with various sensors. 

As of now, the Purple Pedal is compatible with the Daisy Seed C++ toolchain. We are working to make it compatible with Pure Data. 

The Purple Pedal started as a research project & performance art piece created in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh Experimental Guitar Night, and the Open Improv Lab. 

We thank each of these communities for their part in helping us bring open source music hardware to more people <3.
