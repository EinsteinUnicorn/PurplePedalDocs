# Assembly

Here is where we will place all of the links related to assembly. 
I've got a few links here already. 

1. [Electronics](assembly/electronics.md)
2. [Enclosure](assembly/enclosure.md)
3. [Testing the Pedal](assembly/test.md)
4. [Installing the Toolchain](software/toolchain_install.md)
5. [How to write your first pedal program tutorial](software/programming_tutorial.md)
6. [How to upload code to the pedal](software/upload_code.md)
7. [Troubleshooting](assembly/troubleshooting.md)

We may need separate pages to document our build process, but all in due time.
