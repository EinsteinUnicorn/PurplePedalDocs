# Enclosure Assembly

Here is the enclosure page, where we will document the basics on how to assemble the enclosure. We will include some tips on soldering and suggest a logical assembly order.

1. Fasten The Bottom Panel Of The Enclosure

    Screw the PCB onto the bottom panel of the enclosure. Use the provided acrylic spacers in between the board and the bottom panel.

    Note: make sure “interior” or “this side up” is facing up, toward the PCB. Insert the screw with the head facing downward for ease of assembly

2. Fasten the top panel of the enclosure, be sure that the top panel's engravings face outward.

    * Fasten the following to the top panel of the enclosure
    * Push Button
    * LED
    * Potentiometer
    * U-Shaped Acrylic rocker-button

    Then, Connect the wires of these components to their respective terminal blocks on the PCB. For the LED, make sure RED wire is connected to the '+' input on the terminal block.

3. Add The Remaining Panels Of The Enclosure

    Add long side panels to connect the top and bottom of the enclosure and then clip the assbly together with the short side panels

    Note: Be sure the engravings “Input”, “Output”, “Boot”, and “Reset” are facing outward on your assembly.
